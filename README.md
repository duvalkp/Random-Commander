# Random Commander
One of my hobbies is playing the collectible trading card game: Magic the Gathering. I have a group of friends I play with online using the game/simulation app Tabletop Simulator. An add-on for Tabletop Simulator allows you to import any cards to play with very quickly. Magic has different 'formats' which change the basic rules for the games and how they are played. The format known as 'Commander' requires a player to choose a certain type of card (legendary and creature types) to build a deck of cards around. 

We would often not know what to play since we could use any kind of cards we wanted, so I thought it would be fun to make a website that would randomly get you a card to build around as a fun little side project.

The website was tested on desktop mainly, and looks and works strangely on mobile so I reccomend not using a mobile device.
